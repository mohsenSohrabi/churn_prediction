# Customer Churn Prediction 2020
This project is based on the Kaggle competition titled “[Customer Churn Prediction 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/customer-churn-prediction-2020/overview)”. The goal of the competition is to predict customer churn using various machine learning models.

## Project Overview
This project includes code for data preprocessing and the use of different models for prediction. You can find a notebook with more details in the “notebooks” folder. The models used for prediction include xgboost, SVM, and MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron).

## Running the Code
To run the code, you can use the command py main.py on Windows or python main.py on Linux or Mac. It is recommended to have a look at the notebook in the “notebooks” folder to see the preprocessing and modeling process.
